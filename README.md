        <h2>CENTURY SEDAN</h2>
       
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Toyota_Century_GRMN.jpg">
        <p>
        The Toyota Century Sedan is not just a car—it is a symbol of prestige, heritage, and timeless Japanese craftsmanship.
        Hand-built with extraordinary attention to detail, the Century represents the pinnacle of Toyota’s engineering
        philosophy: quiet elegance, absolute comfort, and effortless power. For over half a century, this sedan has served as
        the official vehicle of Japan’s most influential leaders, including prime ministers, senior government officials, and
        business emperors.
        </p> <p>Unlike Western luxury sedans that focus on flashy styling and aggressive performance, the Century takes a different
        approach. It embraces refined minimalism, delivering an experience that is calm, smooth, and almost spiritual. The
        Century’s design is conservative, but every line carries purpose. The deep, mirror-smooth paint is polished by hand for
        hours, using a traditional Japanese technique known as korofune-shiage, which gives the car a dignified and almost
        ceremonial presence on the road.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Inside, the Century sedan becomes a world of its own—a mobile sanctuary of silence and serenity. The rear cabin is a
        masterpiece built for executives and dignitaries. Plush wool upholstery (more breathable and luxurious than leather),
        whisper-quiet insulation, real wood accents, and reclining seats turn the rear compartment into a serene lounge.
        Passengers enjoy features like adjustable ottomans, massage seating, private climate zones, soft-closing doors, and
        entertainment screens designed to create a perfect atmosphere for rest and relaxation.</p> <p>Under the hood, the latest Century Sedan uses a refined 5.0L V8 hybrid powertrain, delivering effortless acceleration
        with minimal noise. Power is abundant, but never aggressive—just smooth, seamless thrust. Whether gliding through city
        streets or traveling long distances, the Century maintains an unshakable composure, absorbing every imperfection in the
        road. The suspension is tuned not for sport, but for absolute comfort, providing a ride that feels as if the car is
        floating quietly above the pavement.</p> <p>The Century has earned its legendary status not through marketing, but through reliability, discretion, and a commitment
        to craftsmanship that borders on obsession. In Japan, it is a cultural icon—a symbol of dignity and respect. Every car
        is assembled by master craftsmen known as Takumi, ensuring that no two units are ever exactly identical. Even the iconic
        phoenix emblem on the hood is hand-engraved, representing rebirth, purity, and unmatched excellence.
        
        The Toyota Century Sedan is more than a luxury vehicle.
        It is a philosophy.
        A tradition.
        A living masterpiece designed for those who value quiet power over loud statements.
        
        In a world where technology and trends come and go, the Century stands timeless—
        a rare blend of Japanese honor, elegance, and engineering perfection.</p>

        <h2>CENTURY SUV</h2>
      
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/2023_Toyota_Century.jpg">
        <p>The Toyota Century SUV is not simply an addition to Toyota’s lineup—it marks the beginning of a new era in global
        luxury. Designed with the same philosophy that shaped the legendary Century Sedan, the Century SUV combines artisan
        craftsmanship, hushed refinement, and superior comfort with the commanding presence and capability of a flagship
        high-end SUV. This is Toyota’s ultimate expression of prestige, created for a new generation of leaders who demand the
        highest level of elegance, privacy, and performance.
        </p> <P>From the outside, the Century SUV presents a bold yet graceful silhouette. Its design avoids unnecessary aggression and
        focuses instead on quiet dominance. The upright stance, sculpted surfaces, and precise lines portray a vehicle that is
        confident without being ostentatious. The Phoenix emblem—hand-crafted by Takumi artisans—sits proudly on the grille,
        symbolizing excellence, rebirth, and the enduring heritage of the Century name. Every detail, from the hand-polished
        paint to the carefully milled chrome accents, reflects a commitment to timeless luxury.</P><P>Step inside, and the Century SUV transports its passengers into a world of serene indulgence. The cabin is designed
        primarily for rear-seat occupants, offering unparalleled levels of comfort and technology. The rear seats recline
        deeply, complete with ottomans, massage functions, and customizable climate zones. The materials are the highest Toyota
        has ever used, including premium wool, high-grade leather, rich natural wood, and meticulously crafted metal
        touchpoints. Every surface feels intentional—every feature designed for effortless elegance.</P><P>Unlike typical luxury SUVs that rely on loud engines for prestige, the Century SUV uses a sophisticated hybrid V6
        powertrain, delivering smooth, silent, and powerful acceleration. The emphasis is not on raw numbers but on effortless
        movement, maintaining exceptional refinement at all speeds. The drive is calm, poised, and tranquil—exactly what a
        flagship should offer. Advanced suspension tuning isolates the cabin from the outside world, allowing passengers to
        glide as if floating on a layer of silence.</P><P>Technology in the Century SUV does not scream for attention; it quietly enhances the experience. A premium entertainment
        suite, acoustic-laminated glass, noise-canceling engineering, and a chauffeur-focused driving mode work together to
        create a cocoon of serenity. Safety systems are cutting-edge, ensuring absolute confidence and control in every
        environment.</P><p>What makes the Century SUV truly exceptional is its purpose. This is not an off-road warrior or a sports machine—this is
        a luxury lounge on wheels, created for those who prioritize dignity, comfort, and sophistication above all else. It is
        crafted for executives, diplomats, global CEOs, and individuals who move through life with purpose and grace. It is the
        spiritual alternative to the Rolls-Royce Cullinan and Mercedes-Maybach GLS, offering an unmistakably Japanese
        interpretation of ultimate luxury.</p><P>In the world of mass-produced luxury SUVs, the Toyota Century SUV stands alone—
        a symbol of quiet power, master craftsmanship, and timeless prestige.
        It invites its passengers not just to travel, but to experience a new definition of elegance.</P>
